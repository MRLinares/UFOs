## Results

The app functions as an interactive website whereby the user can filter data by various criteria.  If the user wants to look for a speciific event they can use all the available filters. The words that populate in the filter box are placeholders that give the user an example of how to enter filters for each respective box.

The available filters are date, city, state, country, and the shape which the viewer experienced the UFO (e.g. the UFO appeared as a light or circle).  Initially, all the data is available and the user will scroll through it.  It is a large dataset, however, so the user can see the data as an example to see how they might want to filter for a specific interest.

## Summary

One major drawback weith the design of this web page, however, is that it isn't novice-friendly so to speak.  The user would have to read through all the data to get an idea of how to filter it, which is a bit counter-intuitive.

A major fix would be a drop-down menu on each filter that would give the user all the available options, such as the available countries or states in the dataset.

Also, there is only data from 2010, having a constantly updated webpage would be much more appealing where we have much more comprehensive information and sightings can be removed if found to be a hoax.
