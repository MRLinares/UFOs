## Results

The app functions as an interactive website whereby the user can filter data by various criteria.  If the user wants to look for a speciific event they can use all the available filters.  The available filters are date, city, state, country, and the shape which the viewer experienced the UFO (e.g. the UFO appeared as a light or circle).  Initially, all the data is available and the user will scroll through it.  It is a large dataset, however, so the user can see the data as an example to see how they might want to filter for a specific interest.
